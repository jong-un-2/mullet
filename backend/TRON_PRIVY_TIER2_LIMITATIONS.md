# Privy Tier 2 TRON Support Limitations

## Problem Summary

Privy's TRON support is classified as "Tier 2", which has significant limitations for embedded wallet signing:

### Key Issues Discovered

1. **raw_sign API Requires App Secret**
   - Privy's `raw_sign` API for Tier 2 chains ONLY accepts Basic Auth (app ID + app secret)
   - User access tokens are NOT supported for raw_sign on Tier 2 chains
   - Error message: `"No valid user session keys available"`

2. **Security Implications**
   - Using app secret from backend means ANY user could potentially sign for ANY wallet
   - Privy requires additional authorization mechanisms (authorization keys, policies, or quorums)
   - Standard embedded wallets don't have these configured by default

3. **Documentation References**
   - [Privy Tier 2 Chains](https://docs.privy.io/recipes/use-tier-2)
   - [Raw Sign API](https://docs.privy.io/api-reference/wallets/raw-sign)
   - [Authorization Keys](https://docs.privy.io/controls/authorization-keys/overview)

## Current Error Flow

```
Frontend (User clicks send)
  ↓
Frontend builds TRC20 transaction
  ↓
Frontend calls backend /api/tron-transaction/sign
  ↓
Backend calls Privy API with user access token
  ↓
❌ Privy returns: "No valid user session keys available"
```

## Why It Fails

From Privy documentation:
> "Authorization: App secret authentication" (for raw_sign API)

This means:
- ✅ Basic Auth with `appId:appSecret` works
- ❌ Bearer token with user access token does NOT work
- ⚠️ But using app secret requires proper authorization key setup

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. ❌ User Access Token (Current Approach)
- **Status**: Failed
- **Error**: "No valid user session keys available"
- **Reason**: Tier 2 chains don't support user session-based signing

### 2. ❌ App Secret Only
- **Status**: Technically works, but UNSAFE
- **Issue**: No user authorization - backend could sign for any wallet
- **Reason**: Privy requires authorization keys/policies to be configured

### 3. ✅ Recommended Solutions

#### Option A: Configure Authorization Keys (Complex)
1. Create authorization key for the app
2. Assign authorization key as signer to user's wallet
3. Configure policies for the signer
4. Use app secret with authorization key

**Pros**: Secure, supported by Privy
**Cons**: Complex setup, requires policy configuration

#### Option B: Use TronLink Extension (Simple)
1. User installs TronLink browser extension
2. User imports Privy wallet private key to TronLink (via export)
3. App uses TronLink for signing instead of Privy

**Pros**: Simple, no backend needed, standard wallet UX
**Cons**: Requires browser extension, extra setup step

#### Option C: Export Private Key & Local Signing (Medium)
1. Use Privy's `exportWallet()` to get private key
2. Store key securely in frontend (session/memory only)
3. Sign transactions locally with TronWeb

**Pros**: No backend, no extension needed
**Cons**: Security concerns, key handling complexity

## Implementation Recommendation

**Short Term**: Option B (TronLink)
- Most practical for immediate use
- Standard wallet experience for TRON users
- No security concerns

**Long Term**: Option A (Authorization Keys)
- Proper Privy integration
- Better UX (no extension needed)
- Requires research and implementation of Privy's authorization system

## Code Changes Needed

### For TronLink Approach:
1. Detect TronLink in frontend
2. Prompt user to import Privy wallet to TronLink (one-time)
3. Use TronLink's `signTransaction()` API
4. Keep Privy for wallet creation/management

### For Authorization Keys Approach:
1. Research Privy's authorization key creation API
2. Implement authorization key assignment to wallets
3. Configure appropriate policies
4. Update backend to use authorization key signatures
5. Implement proper authorization flow

## Status

- **Current**: Blocked on "No valid user session keys" error
- **Next Step**: Implement TronLink fallback or research authorization keys
